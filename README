This repo is for a Java based HTTP/FTP server - 

A Web server that can be invoked from the command line, taking the following parameters, in this order:  
1. Port to listen for connections on. Port 80 is the default HTTP port, but it is often blocked by firewalls, so the server should be able to run on any other port (e.g., 8080).  
2. Root directory of the static web pages. For example, if this is set to the directory /var/www, a request for /mydir/index.html will return the file /var/www/mydir/index.html.
